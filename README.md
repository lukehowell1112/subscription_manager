# Subscription Manager

This application is meant to help with monthly subscriptions, so that one doesn't get lost in their subcription finances. A user will be able to see a list view of all their subscriptions and have teh ability to delete a subscription or add one. When adding a subscription, a user will be prompted to input the frequency, fixed billing amount, billing period, next charge date, category, and notes. The user will also be able to view a spending summary across all subscriptions, with a recurring billing simulation. This application will also include free trial tracking, where a user can input a free trial that they signed up for, and will notify the user a couple days before the firee trial expires.

### Elevator pitch

Don't you just love having the ability to have numerous streams of media all at the access of your hands through subscriptions, however may feel the overbearing weight of not knowing how much it is all costs? Or wonder if you are still paying for a subscription that you stopped using months or years ago? The Subscription Tracker appliaction makes it vary easy to track your subscription expenses and organize them all into one place. Allowing you to centralize subscription tracking, calculate true monthly costs, while also sending reminders for trials and renewals. This easily converts a blind spot in finances to a simple instrument board.

### Technologies

- **HTML** - This will help give structure. 5 pages of html: the dashboard, editing the dashboard, adding a subscription, deleting a subscription, editing a subscription
- **CSS** - Used in the overall look of the interface. Different uses of color and whitespace, to make the application look appealing. It will also be used in sizing the diffrent interactive features of the application.
- **React** - Used to allow the user to input edits, login, choose an edit, add a subscription and its corresponding information, delete a subscription, navigate back to the dashboard, and make edits to a subscription.
- **Service** - Included endpoints are: login, the dashboard, choosing an edit, retrieving information for a new subscription, deleting a subscription, and editing a subscription
- **DB/Login** - Stores the user with subscriptions and its corresponding information. Registers the user and saves the data in the database.
- **WebSocket** - The data will be displayed back to the user in the dashboard with its corresponding elements, and included in the calculation for monthly expenses.
