A user will be able to see a list view of all their subscriptions and have the ability to delete a subscription or add one. When adding a subscription, a user will be prompted to input the frequency, fixed billing amount, billing period, next charge date, category, and notes. The user will also be able to view a spending summary across all subscriptions, with a recurring billing simulation. This application will also include free trial tracking, where a user can input a free trial that they signed up for, and will notify the user a couple days before the firee trial expires.",
